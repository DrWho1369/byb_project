# My First GitHub Project

## Project Overview

This is my first GitHub project, created to demonstrate my understanding of version control with Git and GitHub. The project consists of a simple Python script that prints a function to the terminal.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DrWho1369/byb_project
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd byb_project
```

3. Run the Python script:

```bash
python helloWorld.py
```

4. You should see the function printed to the terminal.
